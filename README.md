# Halberds & Helmets

This repository contains the source files for the English copy of my
house rules for the role playing games at my table. There are two PDFs
in the main directory: the
[Player Handbook](Halberds-and-Helmets.pdf) and the
[Referee Guide](Halberds-and-Helmets-Ref-Guide.pdf).

The subdirectories contain adventures.

Note that there is an
[online character generator](https://campaignwiki.org/halberdsnhelmets/en).

If you want to report bugs, provide feedback, fix typos or collaborate
in any other way, feel free to
